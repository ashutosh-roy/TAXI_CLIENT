The Biggest Issue In Todays World Is Global Warming
The Main Pollutant Is co2
Car emssion has a lot of co2
We see Many People travelling alone in a 4 seater car so if 4 people are travelling alone then they use 4 different cars and their is extra co2 emission.
So using one car is a far better option
