# Taxi-Share-Client
Are you a **travel agent** or **airline**? This application will allow you to check if :taxi: **taxi shares** are available for the passengers of a specific flight.

Within your code you only need to provide two parameters: the **flight number** and the **arrival date**.

You could then say to the customer: 

*Hey, there are passengers on your flight willing to share a taxi to city upon arrival.* 
An added value at zero cost to the agency.

If no shares are found you could still tell the passenger:
*Did you know that you can offer to share a taxi to city to other passengers of your flight?
